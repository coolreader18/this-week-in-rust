## Updates from the Rust Project

342 pull requests were [merged in the last week](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+org%3Arust-lang+is%3Amerged+merged%3A2023-08-14..2023-08-21&type=pullrequests)

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week with very few real regressions and some good improvements through work done by @cjgillot who found a few spots where the compiler was doing unnecessary work.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [e845910..d4a881](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=e8459109bbb440764c1c877032189a27b9e76c4e&end=d4a881e1433cd10e424843353e1f939f5a798f4e&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ‚ùå <br /> (primary)    | 1.4%  | [0.5%, 2.6%]   | 13    |

3 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
28 artifact comparisons made in total

are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
